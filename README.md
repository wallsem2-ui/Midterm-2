# Midterm-2
Part 1 of this project looks at dairy production and consumption trends. I chose to look globally at the data, and examine how countries compare to the global average. For both consumption and production the world average is fairly low with a few outliers that are much higher. Additionally, looking at the entire globe for production and consumption, many countries appear to be on the lower end, with a few excpetions (including the USA and India being much highrt in production). For the most part, production and consumption are not very correlated with most countries being very low in production across varying consumption levels. Overall, these plots tell us that there are a couple major producers of milk and many consumers. *See dash1, dash2, and dash3

Part 2 of this project looks at Taylor Swift album data and examines the differences in sentiment. The main sentiments of folklore were different than Red. Some of most commonly used words in folklore include time, love, mad, and heart. Time, red, trouble, and stay were most commonly used in Red. Additionally, the sentiment proportion is more negative for folklore and more positive for Red. The danceability, loudness, and energy are higher for Red. Overall, these visuals show that folklore is slighlty slower and more negative as an album.
